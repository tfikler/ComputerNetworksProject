Bonus Implementation Details - OPTIONS operation
We implemented the OPTIONS operation:
The client can ask from the server which operations he can do on a specific file
and get it as the header "allow".
example:
Request:
OPTIONS /index.html HTTP/1.1
Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST
